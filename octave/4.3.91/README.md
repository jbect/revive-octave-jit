I have tested Octave RC 4.3.91 with the following versions of LLVM:

* LLVM 3.6: [make fails](./make-fails-LLVM-3.5.2)

* LLVM 3.6: [make fails](./make-fails-LLVM-3.6.2)

* LLVM 3.7: [make fails](./make-fails-LLVM-3.7.1)

* LLVM 3.8: make succeeds

* LLVM 3.9: [make fails](./make-fails-LLVM-3.9.1)


Currently only LLVM 3.8 is supported (with very limited functionality anyway).
